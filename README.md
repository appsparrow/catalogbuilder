## ðŸš€ Build & Deployment

### Quick Build
```bash
npm run build
```

### Clean Build (Recommended for deployment)
```bash
npm run build:clean
```

### Deployment Build (Handles dependency issues)
```bash
npm run build:deploy
```

### Using Build Script
```bash
./build.sh
```

### Cloudflare R2 image storage

Images are uploaded to Cloudflare R2 via a Cloudflare Pages Function and served through Cloudflare CDN (zero egress from Supabase):
x
- Function: `functions/api/upload-image.ts`
- Binding: `R2_BUCKET` (R2 bucket binding)
- Env var: `R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` (public base URL to your bucket; no trailing slash)

Configure in Cloudflare Pages â†’ Project â†’ Settings:
1. Bindings â†’ R2 â†’ Add binding named `R2_BUCKET` pointing to your bucket
2. Environment variables â†’ add `R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` with your public bucket URL or CDN hostname

The app posts multipart/form-data to `/api/upload-image` and stores returned URLs in Supabase tables.

### Step-by-step: Set up Cloudflare R2 with this app

1) Create an R2 bucket
   - Cloudflare Dashboard â†’ R2 â†’ Create bucket
   - Name example: `catalogbuilder`

2) Make objects publicly readable
   - Option A (simple): Enable Public Bucket or add an R2 Custom Domain for the bucket
   - Copy your public base URL (no trailing slash), e.g. `https://<bucket>.<accountid>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com` or `https://cdn.example.com`

3) Bind R2 to your Cloudflare Pages project
   - Cloudflare Dashboard â†’ Pages â†’ your project â†’ Settings â†’ Environment variables and Bindings
   - R2 bindings â†’ Add binding
     - Variable name: `R2_BUCKET`
     - Bucket: select your bucket from step 1

4) Add environment variable for public URL
   - Same page â†’ Environment variables â†’ Add variable
     - Name: `R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`
     - Value: the public base URL from step 2 (no trailing slash)

5) Deploy the app
   - Push these repo changes or trigger a new build to ensure the Pages Function is deployed
   - The function lives at `functions/api/upload-image.ts`

6) Verify uploads work
   - Open your deployed preview URL
   - Test image upload in the UI (products, bulk, logo)
   - In Supabase, new rows should reference `image_url` pointing to your R2 domain

7) (Optional) Migrate existing images from Supabase to R2
   - Export `products.image_url` and any other image fields from Supabase
   - For each URL: download the file and re-upload via `/api/upload-image` (prefix `products/`), or upload directly using the R2 S3-compatible API
   - Update the corresponding DB rows with the new R2 URLs

Notes
- Local dev via `npm run dev` does not run Cloudflare Functions. To test the `/api/upload-image` endpoint locally, use a Cloudflare preview deployment or run a local Pages dev environment with Wrangler.

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Build Issues

If you encounter Rollup/npm dependency errors during build:

1. **Use the deployment build script:**
   ```bash
   npm run build:deploy
   ```

2. **Clean install:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps --ignore-optional
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Platform-specific issues:**
   - Uses `@vitejs/plugin-react` instead of `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` to avoid native binding issues
   - Standard Vite configuration without complex overrides
   - Simple `.npmrc` with only essential flags
