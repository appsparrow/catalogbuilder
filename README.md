```

## ðŸš€ Build & Deployment

### Quick Build
```bash
npm run build
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Build Issues

If you encounter Rollup/npm dependency errors during build:

1. **Use the deployment build script:**
   ```bash
   npm run build:deploy
   ```

2. **Clean install:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps --ignore-optional
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Platform-specific issues:**
   - Uses `@vitejs/plugin-react` instead of `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` to avoid native binding issues
   - Standard Vite configuration without complex overrides
   - Simple `.npmrc` with only essential flags
