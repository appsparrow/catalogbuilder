When deploying React + Vite projects to Cloudflare Pages:

1. ALWAYS use @vitejs/plugin-react (Babel-based)
2. NEVER use @vitejs/plugin-react-swc (SWC has native binding issues)
3. Keep package.json simple - no overrides or complex dependencies
4. Use standard Vite configuration without platform-specific optimizations
5. If user reports "Failed to load native binding" or "@swc/core" errors, immediately switch to Babel plugin

This is a known issue - SWC fails on Cloudflare Pages due to native module incompatibilities.
Babel is the industry standard and works everywhere.
